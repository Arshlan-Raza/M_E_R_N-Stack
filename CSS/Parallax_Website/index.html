            <h2 class="sechead">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text"> It is rightly said, “Jobs fill your pockets but adventures fill your soul”. 
                Most people view adventure as something that is undertaken as a break from the mundane routine, for others adventure is a way of life.
                An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”

            <p class="text"> <br><br>Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. 
                The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>

            </div>

            <p class="text"><br><br>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. <br><br>

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>

            </div>

            <p class="text"> <br><br>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools. <br><br>

                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. 
                The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
